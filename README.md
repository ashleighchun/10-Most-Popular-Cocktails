# 10 Best Cocktails
### This is an adaptation of the original gem written by ashleighchun. I have added in CSS selectors in the environment.rb file, and updated the scraped urls to use https instead of http.

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view the 10 best cocktails and a guide to how to make them as per the '10 Most Popular Cocktails to Order at Bars 2018' article on the Esquire website.

## Installation

    $ gem install best-cocktails

## Usage

Type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

    $ best-cocktails

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
